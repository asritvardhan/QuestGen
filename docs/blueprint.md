## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft, muted blue (#77B5FE) to convey trustworthiness and intellect, aligning with educational content. Chosen because educational materials often aim to be taken seriously but also approachable.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F2F5), almost white, to provide a clean and non-distracting backdrop for learning material.
- Accent color: Yellow-Orange (#FFB74D), an analogous color to the primary, to highlight key UI elements such as CTAs.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headers to create a technical yet approachable feel; body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text for optimal readability.
- Use clean, line-based icons to represent question types, syllabus input methods, and Bloom's Taxonomy levels.
- Maintain a clean and well-organized layout, prioritizing clear sections for syllabus input, generated questions, and download options. The focus is readability and ease of navigation.
- Incorporate subtle loading animations to indicate AI processing, to improve user experience during question generation. Do not animate buttons or text.
